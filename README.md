### Follow-Up:

This coding challenge was given a time frame of 1.5 hours. If I had more time, I would've implemented validations to be checked when creating walls. I would've created additional testing in order to prevent any edge case scenarios. I would've completed all the remaining CRUD actions for the Wall and Comment models. I would've made it so that the comment model uses the user's username rather than have you input a username when creating a comment each time. I would've created an one-to-one assocation between the user and wall models. I would've liked for each user to have only one wall in which other users can post comments on. I would've created a profile page for users. I would've created a scope on the user's profile page that displays the 10 most recent comments a user has posted on walls, as well as a link to their personal wall.
